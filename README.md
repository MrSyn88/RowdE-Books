## Built with Vite
This project utilizes [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to help improve development build times. Project was initially created with `create-react-app`, however, after some research it appears Meta/Facebook no longer is supporting this method of creating React applications.

## Clone and Using Locally
To clone this repo and run the webpage locally run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrSyn88/RowdE-Books
```
```bash
cd RowdE-Books/
npm install
```
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Hosting
